# General Flow of Backend
index.js (main file) -> user.route.js (routes user related functions) -> user.controller.js (controller for user related functions) -> user.service.js (actually deals with the mongodb)

## Other info
1. Currently just using a local mongodb database, will look into an online one at a later date
2. Also using Postman for testing the backend functions
